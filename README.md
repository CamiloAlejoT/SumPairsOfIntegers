# Mach Eight

## Set up

install dependencies with `npm install`

## Task

The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as well as the target sum.
​
Sample output is shown below.
```
> app 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
​
+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4
​
```
In the example, there is an executable named `app`. It takes as command line arguments a comma separated list of integers, and the target integer. Your app doesn't need to have identical input/output mechanisms. For example, you could read from a file instead of the command line.
​
You can assume that all input values are integers. You can assume that there aren't any repeat values in the list. The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2). All edge cases should be handled appropriately. This is _not_ a closed book test. You are encouraged to reach out with any questions that you come across.
## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest]

## Test final solution

Go into src folder, there is a file named main.js, that file gest 3 inputs. 
1. The length of the array 
2. The minimum number of the range that are going to be into the array
3. The maximum number of the range that are going to be into the array

run `node main.js 1 2 3` (one, two and three are related with the input) for example `node main.js 1000000 -10000 10000`.
